# Smart Parcel Sorting System

## Overview
The Smart Parcel Sorting System is a C++ application designed to manage and organize parcels efficiently within Saudi Arabia. The program allows users to enqueue parcels, process them in batches using stack, sort them based on priority using linked list, and load them for delivery. With a user-friendly interface, it simplifies parcel management in various cities and districts.

### Features:
- Add parcels to a queue with details such as recipient, city, zone, and priority.
- Display incoming parcels and their statuses.
- Process parcels in batches, reversing the order for sorting.
- Sort parcels based on priority (standard or overnight).
- Load parcels into a truck based on selected city for delivery.
- Display a hierarchy of regions, cities, and districts.
